 üöñ Ola Rides Marketplace Analysis: Bengaluru (Sept 2025)
üìå Project Overview

Analyzed 50,000+ Ola ride bookings in Bengaluru to understand cancellation patterns, demand‚Äìsupply dynamics, and financial performance.

Tools: SQL (data cleaning, transformations, aggregations) & Power BI (data modeling, DAX, dashboards).

Goal: Optimize service efficiency, reduce cancellations, and identify actionable revenue opportunities.

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

Data Preparation (SQL)

Cleaned and standardized booking data.

Aggregated KPIs: Cancellation rate, Avg Ride Distance, Booking Value.

Created SQL views for Power BI integration.

Data Modeling (Power BI)

Built Star Schema with relationships.

Developed DAX measures: Total Booking Value, Avg Ride Value/km, VTAT (Vehicle Time to Arrive).

Visualization (Power BI Dashboards)

Interactive dashboards with filters by vehicle type, payment method, location, and time.

Heatmaps for cancellation hotspots and demand peaks.

2. Operational Efficiency

Higher Avg VTAT correlated with increased cancellations.

Fleet performance: Prime Sedan had highest ratings but more cancellations vs. Autos/Mini.
